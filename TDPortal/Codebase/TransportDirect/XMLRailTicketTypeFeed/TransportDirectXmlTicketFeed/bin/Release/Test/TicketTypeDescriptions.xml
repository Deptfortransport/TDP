    <Retailing>You can buy a season ticket at any staffed ticket office. If you are buying a monthly or longer season ticket for the first time, you'll need to complete an application form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- You will need a recent passport-type photograph for the accompanying photo card &lt;br&gt;
- To avoid the queues, it's best to avoid buying your ticket on weekday mornings &lt;br&gt;
- If you already have a photocard, you may be able to buy seven day season tickets at self-service ticket machines&lt;br&gt;
- You may also be able to buy your tickets over the telephone or internet from the appropriate Train Company.</Retailing>
    <BookingDeadlines>You may be able to buy your Season Ticket before the day it is due to start. However, to avoid misuse of season tickets, they can only be purchased a short period of time beforehand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full details are available on our &lt;a href='http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/season_tickets/'&gt;Season Ticket&lt;/a&gt; information page.</BookingDeadlines>

    <Refunds>Any refund is calculated from the date the Season Ticket was handed in. It will be the difference between the price you paid and the cost of a ticket or tickets for the period for which you have actually used the ticket, plus an administration charge. &lt;br&gt;Because of the discounts on longer term Season Tickets, refunds are not made pro rata to the periods before/after surrender and Annual Season Tickets have no refund value after about 10 1/2 months. For this reason we recommend that employers' Annual Season Ticket loan schemes are set up so that reimbursements are made in 10 equal monthly payments with two 'free' months at the end of the year, rather than in 12 equal monthly payments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There must be at least seven days remaining on a Monthly Season Ticket or at least three days remaining on a 7 Day Season Ticket to obtain a refund (although on some 7 Day Season Tickets there may be no refund value after three days of use, dependent upon the relevant Standard Day Return price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In cases of illness, the refund can be backdated if you produce suitable documentary evidence for a period before you hand in your ticket, provided that you have not started travelling again using your Season Ticket since your illness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We do not give refunds or allow Season Tickets to be extended for periods of non-use, for example holidays. We do not normally give refunds on duplicate Season Tickets although consideration will be given if you can give written evidence of redundancy, prolonged illness or similar circumstances or if the original ticket is recovered and returned to the issuing ticket office within one month of its loss. Please ask at the ticket office for more details.</Refunds>

Tickets may only be used on the services of the Train Company (or geographic route where applicable) shown next to Route on the ticket. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

If the Route also states and Connections, travel is allowed on appropriate connecting trains where shown on the ticket(s) or other valid travel itinerary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

If the route is prefixed with a +, the ticket includes the cost of travelling across London on London Underground, Docklands Light Railway or First Capital Connect (Thameslink Route) services as appropriate to the journey.</Availability>

Changes to tickets cannot be made on-board the train. If you board a train without a ticket and reservation for that service, a new ticket must be purchased.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
