    <Comments>Across the region bus services will run at a reduced level during the holidays. There will be something close to Saturday working on December 24th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st December and Sunday services on 2nd and 3rd January 2005. There will be no bus services on December 25th and special services will run on 26th and 27th December and on 1st January 2005. Because it is possible that not all the alterations will be reflected in journeys that you plan using Transport Direct, you are advised to call Traveline on 0870 608 2608 for up to the minute details. Buses will be back to normal on Tuesday January 4th 2005.</Comments>

    <Comments>Transport Direct is being updated weekly to show holiday period details as they become available for individual operators and their services.  Until detailed information is available Transport Direct will show the following: 24 Dec, all services finish before 2000; 25/26 Dec, no service; 27/28 Dec, Sunday service; 29/30 Dec, Saturday service; 31 Dec, Saturday service finishing before 2000 and 1/2/3 Jan, Sunday service. We expect to have almost all holiday details in Transport Direct by 11 December, but a few late entries may not be available until 18 December.  All journey plans for the holiday period should be checked after 18 December.</Comments>
